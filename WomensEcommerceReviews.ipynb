    "This project consists of some exploratory data analysis followed by the training of some natural language processing models. We approach this with two objectives. First, we try to predict if a review left on an item's page will be influential on other customers from its title and text. Second, we train a model to predict whether a reviewer will, in the end, recommend the item they purchased. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a review's influence would be valuable to any retailer, because they could float possibly useful reviews to the top of an item's page to create a better user experience without waiting for that review to get the necessary engagement to reach that spot. It would also provide insight as to what types of issues actually cause people to reconsider their purchase so they can be addressed. Finally, a more sly application of a model of this nature would be to hide potentially influential negative reviews, or highlight influential postive reviews. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining if a review recommends the item or not is easier to do than predicting influence. On this dataset, users were required to chose whether or not they recommend the item they bought so the retailer would have that information anyways. This doesn't mean that training this model is useless, but rather it can help as a possible filter. In particular, it would be interesting to see where the model gets its predictions wrong. A wrong prediction would happen on a review that says positive things about the item but ultimately doesn't recommend others buy it or, on the flipside, says negative things about the item but recommends it anyways. This behavior indicates that the reviewer is acting in good faith and possibly has some constructive criticism that the company can use to improve their products. This way, a large retailer could wade through thousands of reviews and only keep those that provide valuable insight, saving time and effort. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of these constructive reviews being useful to the retailer, they would also prove useful to the customers, as they would most likely contain commentary on the nature of the product and its quality. This way the company could provide a better user experience by floating these reviews to the top as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has the next information:\n",
    "- __Clothing ID__: Refers to the ID of the specific item of clothing being reviewed\n",
    "- __Age__: Age of the person posting the review\n",
    "- __Title__: Title of the review, if there is one\n",
    "- __Review Text__: Text of the review\n",
    "- __Rating__: Ratings on a 1-to-5 scale\n",
    "- __Recommended IND__: Binary value on whether they recommend the item\n",
    "- __Positive Feedback Count__: Count of how many users found the review 'positive'* \n",
    "- __Division Name__: Refers to whether the item is general, general petite or intimates\n",
    "- __Department Name__: Refers to the item type more specifically: tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.\n",
    "- __Class Name__: Refers to even more specific classifications: Blouses, Sweaters, Jackets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The source of this dataset doesn't actually explain what Positive Feedback Count would be, so we are working under the assumption that this represents how many 'Likes' a review gets, but really we're just guessing\n",

    "This project consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we retrieve our data and clean it\n",
    "    - Luckily, not much cleaning is actually required \n",
    "- Then we do some exploratory data analysis to see if we can gleen anything about our data. This includes:\n",
    "    - Studying the age of our users\n",
    "    - Studying how long reviews are, in characters\n",
    "    - Studying how long review titles are, in characters\n",
    "    - Trying to determine if there is a relationship between title/review length and rating\n",
    "- Next we try to determine if reviews are 'Impactful' or not from their Positive Feedback Count\n",
    "- Moving from this data analysis, we train 4 different Natural Language Processing models:\n",
    "    - A model that tries to predict if a review is impactful from its title\n",
    "    - A model that tries to predict if a review recommends the item they purchased from its title\n",
    "    - A model that tries to predict if a review is impactful from its review text\n",
    "    - A model that tries to predict if a review recommends the item they purchased from its review text\n",
    "   \n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook you can find not only all the code and the visualizations generated, but also a general step by step explanation of the logic used throughout and the conclusions we can come to from the results of the project. With that being said, here is a summarized list of the results achieved and the conclusions we can reach from them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although we already knew this store caters to women, it seems that the demographic is primarily middle aged.\n",
    "- Most reviews have very short or no title at all while the actual body of the review tends to be incredibly long\n",
    "- Review title and text length seem to have a correlation to the rating a customer leaves. It seems that the longer a review is, the less likely it is to be a 5 star rating\n",
    "- A vast majority of reviews have no Positive Feedback Count, which would mean that most reviews either go unread or simply don't provide any useful commentary.\n",
    "    - We have no way of knowing which of these is correct, and this will prove to be a big problem. More information is needed\n",
    "- On the results of the training of forecasting models:\n",
    "    - There simply isn't enough information to reliably predict whether a review will have an impact on the viewer or not. Adding another variable like a review's view counter would help a lot and actually make this possible.\n",
    "    - Using a forecasting model for filtering reviews to gather those with constructive criticism or useful information seems to be a success, as we were able to collect reviews that actually comment on why a piece should not be bought or things a customer should look out for like strange cuts, poor fabric quality or the item not looking like the picture on the website\n",

Furthermore, we can see that we have 473 users over the age of 70, 80 and even 90, with two users registered as being 99 years old. While this is within the realm of possibility, it's more likely that a lot of users are intentionally misreporting their age when using the site. After all, most websites have you self-reporting your age and don't ask for verification. This further skews our age data towards the older side.<br>\n",

After all, most people who are happy with a purchase they made in a brick-and-mortar store will just walk away while someone unhappy with the product is more likely to return and complain or demand a refund. The fact that this behaviour carries over into e-commerce is hardly surprising."

    "So a majority of reviews are unimpactful by our definition. This makes sense, as a lot of reviews have no text or title, and many reviews probably don't go into detail beyond simple praise like \"I love it\". Two other explanations are that a lot of reviews will just be buried under other reviews and will never have the chance to make and impact and that, just like a lot of people simply aren't compelled to leave a review title in and of itself, a lot of people  just don't think to hit the 'Like' button. Now let's separate these by whether the reviews recommended the item or not."

    "But what is so difficult about it? Well, determining what makes a review impactful or not is difficult when you only have one variable from which to measure a review's value. This 'Positive Feedback Count' on its own, while its a useful metric, is not enough to determine if a review is truly effectual. We know that a review with a Positive Feedback Count of 120 is truly impactful, but a review with a count of 5? 10? Difficult to say. <br>\n",

If we had more information on a reviews impact then creating a more accurate Impact label would be easier and a better model could be trained. <br>\n",
